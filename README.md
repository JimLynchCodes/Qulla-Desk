## How Much Does This Amazing Tool Cost?

We haven't build any kind of paywall of commissions charges into it yet, so technically it's free.

We developers (<a href="https://twitter.com/JimLynchCodes">Jim</a>. and <a href="https://twitter.com/Qullamaggie">Jay</a>.) want to hear from you, the users, what kind of business model you would be into.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Qullamaggie">Kirstjan Kullamaggie</a>.
There are lots of options... here are a few:

  - a flat and / or variable rate on trades / trade size placed through the app.
  
  - a "freemium" model where you can use _most_ the fancy entry and exit features for a limited number of stocks for free, and you paid a premium subscription fee to unlock autmation for more stocks / features at once.
